Git-Package-Management
======================

MODx extra that allows you to manage external packages.

For more information please visit [wiki](https://github.com/TheBoxer/Git-Package-Management/wiki).

Some included, that you can try:
 * [ChromePHP](https://github.com/TheBoxer/ChromePHP_MODX)
 * [UrlShortener](https://github.com/TheBoxer/UrlShortener)
 
I made config for Articles, so you can try them too. Just create [config.json](http://pastebin.com/wDQGKbnh) in _build folder. Since Articles has some dependencies, don't forgot to download and install them vua package manager (Quip, etc.).

Feel free to contact me on pecajan@gmail.com with ideas and bugs.
